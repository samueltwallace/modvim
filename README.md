# Modular Vim


This is an effort to try to modularize my (neo)vim setup by creating many different config files for different uses. I find vim a bit slow and can be overburdened with too many options when working with a monolithic vimrc. I think I am starting to find a tool for every job to be not as good at a specific job. Thus, modular vim. I also think a modular vim makes for more digestible reading and more accessible forking.

I currently edit mostly LaTeX, so there won't be as much for other stuff. We'll see how this goes.
